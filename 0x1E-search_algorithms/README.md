<h1>SEARCH ALGORITHIMS</h1>

<p>This is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem.</p>
<p>They work to retrive info stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem dmain, with either discrete or continuous value.</p>

<h3>TYPES</h3>

<h4>Linear search algorithms</h4>
<p>check every record for theone associated with a target key in a linear fashion.</p>

<h4>Binary search</h4>
<p>searches repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half</p>

<h4>Comparison search algorithms</h4>
<p>improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the ley until the target record is found.</p>

<h4>Digital search</h4>
<p>work based on the properties of digits in data structures by usingnumerical keys.</p>

<h4>Hashing</h4>
<p>directly maps keys to records based on hash functions</p>

<h2>SPACE COMPLEXITY</h2>
<p>This is the total space taken bythe algorithm with respect to the input size.</p>
